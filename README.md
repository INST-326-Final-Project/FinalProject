# Final Project: Factors Influencing Life Expectancy Rates.

# Proposal: 
* Using a dataset from Kaggle.com (Life Expectancy), our team will employ a variety of python techniques to identify various factors that influence the life expectancy rates in a given country (or countries).

## Technologies 
* This project will be developed using python 3 IDEs (such as VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, & PyCharm). 

## Setup 
* In order to run this file, please have the latest version of Python 3 downloaded.
* For the life_expectancy_cleaning.py file, please be sure to specify the filepath in where you would like to export the csv file after the dataframe changes.  

## File Purposes
* Life Expectancy.csv: Original Life Expectancy csv file without any changes made from Kaggle.com. 
* life_expectancy_cleaning.py: python file that includes code used to clean the original Life Expectancy csv file. 
* cleaned_life_expectancydf.csv: Life expectancy file after having bad/null data removed. This file and its' dataset will be used for the Final Project. 

## Annotated Bibliography (APA Format) 
* Rajarshi, K. (2018, February 10). Life Expectancy (WHO). Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
   * CSV file that provides factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rate. Data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for        193 countries. The dataset will answer possible negative or positive correlation between life expectancy with year, polio, total expenditure, schooling, income composition      of resources, alcohol, diphtheria, adult Mortality, and population.

## Status Update (04/2/21)-Leek 
* Created the Project 4 ReadMe file.
* Added original Life Expectancy.csv file to team repository.
* Successfully cleaned the original life expectancy csv file, has been renamed into "cleaned_life_expectancydf.csv" and has been added to team repository.
* Created annotated bibliography on word document. Will complete once project has been finished.

## (4/4/21)-Leek
* Added Side effects to dropValues(): function in life_expectancy_cleaning.py.
