# Final Project: Factors Influencing Life Expectancy Rates.

# Proposal: 
* Using a dataset from Kaggle.com (Life Expectancy), our team will employ a variety of python techniques to identify various factors that influence the life expectancy rates in a given country (or countries).

## Technologies 
* This project will be developed using python 3 IDEs (such as VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, & PyCharm). 

## Setup 
* In order to run this file, please have the latest version of Python 3 downloaded.
* For the life_expectancy_cleaning.py file, please be sure to specify the filepath in where you would like to export the csv file after the dataframe changes.  

## File Purposes
* Life Expectancy.csv: Original Life Expectancy csv file without any changes made from Kaggle.com. 
* life_expectancy_cleaning.py: python file that includes code used to clean the original Life Expectancy csv file. 
* cleaned_life_expectancydf.csv: Life expectancy file after having bad/null data removed. This file and its' dataset will be used for the Final Project. 

## Annotated Bibliography (APA Format) 
* Rajarshi, K. (2018, February 10). Life Expectancy (WHO). Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who
* CSV file that provides factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition, and mortality rate. Data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for 193 countries. The dataset will answer possible negative or positive correlation between life expectancy with eating habits, smoking, drinking alcohol, lifestyle, or exercise.

## Status Update (04/2/21)-Leek 
* Created the Project 4 ReadMe file.
* Added original Life Expectancy.csv file to team repository.
* Successfully cleaned the original life expectancy csv file, has been renamed into "cleaned_life_expectancydf.csv" and has been added to team repository.
* Created annotated bibliography on word document. Will complete once project has been finished.

## (4/4/21)-Leek
* Added Side effects to dropValues(): function in life_expectancy_cleaning.py. 

## (4/11/21)-Leek 
* Added Final_Project_Life_Expectancy.py file to team repository. 

## (4/15/21)-Joon 
* Added Annotated Bibliography for Life Expectancy.csv file 

## (4/14/21)-Josh
* Added method for our class and came up with the input idea for our dataframe.
